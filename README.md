# XAPI Profiles spec review / upgrade in progress

After the publication of the [xAPI 2.0](https://opensource.ieee.org/xapi/xapi-base-standard-documentation) the [IEEE p9274.2.1](https://sagroups.ieee.org/9274-2-1/) working group has been established to move forward the xAPI profiles spec. If your interested and want to improve the profiles spec, join the WG! by [subscribing to the email list](https://sagroups.ieee.org/9274-2-1/subscribe-to-email-list/).

## xapi-profiles
This is a companion specification to the core xAPI Specification that addresses the structure and supporting services for xAPI Profiles.

A profile is the human and/or machine-readable documentation of application-specific concepts, statement patterns, extensions, and statement templates used when implementing xAPI in a particular context. In a nutshell, a profile documents the vocabulary concepts, extensions, statement templates, and patterns that are required for xAPI to be implemented consistently for a specific use case. A profile empowers designers and developers to establish a controlled, domain-specific vocabulary and determine what data should be captured/stored and reported on. In other words, a profile really is the blueprint for a successful, semantically interoperable xAPI implementation.

This Github repository contains the xAPI Profiles Specification. [xAPI](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec) is a learning
technologies interoperability specification that describes communication
about learner activity and experiences between technologies. The xAPI Profiles Specification stands as a
companion to xAPI, and is divided into three documents:

* Part One: [About xAPI Profiles](./xapi-profiles-about.md)
* Part Two: [xAPI Profiles Structure](./xapi-profiles-structure.md)
* Part Three: [xAPI Profiles Communication and Processing](./xapi-profiles-communication.md)

## Specification versions

The current version of the specification is
[1.0](https://github.com/DataInteroperability/xapi-profiles).

## Authored Profiles

ADL maintains a [public repository of authored xAPI profiles](https://github.com/adlnet/xapi-authored-profiles) based on this specification and processes provided by ADL's vocabulary and profile index, [http://xapi.vocab.pub](http://xapi.vocab.pub). 

## What to do if the spec is unclear

If when implementing the specification you find something is unclear or
unhelpful, you can help to improve the xAPI Profiles specification by
[raising an issue here](https://github.com/DataInteroperability/xapi-profiles/issues). When
raising an issue, please give as much detail as you can in regards to:

* Which part/parts of the specification you are reading.
* Your understanding of what these parts mean.
* The product and feature you are implementing xAPI Profiles in; what's the use case you
  are trying to achieve? What user stories are you trying to support?
* How you would like the specification to be improved? Suggest some specific new
  wording if you like!

You'll need to [sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) if
you do not already have one in order to raise and comment on issues.

You can discuss any issues before or after raising them on the
