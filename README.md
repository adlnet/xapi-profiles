# xapi-profiles
A set of documents addressing the structure of and supporting services for xAPI Profiles.

This Github repository contains the xAPI Profiles Specification. [xAPI](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec) is a learning
technologies interoperability specification that describes communication
about learner activity and experiences between technologies. The xAPI Profiles Specification stands as a
companion to xAPI, and is divided into three documents:

* Part One: [About xAPI Profiles](./xapi-profiles-about.md)
* Part Two: [xAPI Profiles Structure](./xapi-profiles-structure.md)
* Part Three: [xAPI Profiles Communication and Processing](./xapi-profiles-communication.md)

## Specification versions

The current version of the specification is
[1.0](https://github.com/DataInteroperability/xapi-profiles).

## What to do if the spec is unclear

If when implementing the specification you find something is unclear or
unhelpful, you can help to improve the xAPI Profiles specification by
[raising an issue here](https://github.com/DataInteroperability/xapi-profiles/issues). When
raising an issue, please give as much detail as you can in regards to:

* Which part/parts of the specification you are reading.
* Your understanding of what these parts mean.
* The product and feature you are implementing xAPI Profiles in; what's the use case you
  are trying to achieve? What user stories are you trying to support?
* How you would like the specification to be improved? Suggest some specific new
  wording if you like!
